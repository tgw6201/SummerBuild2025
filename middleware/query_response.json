  "response": "Okay, I can help you with that! Based on your dietary restrictions (vegetarian, halal), allergies (peanuts, shellfish), and available ingredients, we need to create a recipe that avoids pork and focuses on the vegetarian-friendly options.\n\nUnfortunately, the provided ingredients list includes pork, which is not suitable for a vegetarian or halal diet. Since we need to adhere to your preferences, we'll need to exclude the pork entirely.  That leaves us with a limited set of ingredients for a single recipe.\n\nLet's create a simple **Blueberry Muffins recipe** using the remaining ingredients. This will be a good way to use up the flour, brown sugar, olive oil, eggs, almond milk, baking soda, and blueberries.\n\n**Recipe: Blueberry Muffins (Vegetarian, Halal, Peanut & Shellfish-Free)**\n\nThis recipe will yield approximately 6 muffins.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n*   1.5 cups whole wheat flour\n*   0.25 cup brown sugar\n*   2.0 tablespoons olive oil\n*   1.0 large egg\n*   0.75 cup almond milk\n*   1.0 teaspoon baking soda\n*   1.0 cup blueberries\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Preheat & Prep:** Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it well.\n2.  **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour and baking soda.\n3.  **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In a separate bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, olive oil, egg, and almond milk.\n4.  **Combine Wet & Dry:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. A few lumps are okay.\n5.  **Fold in Blueberries:** Gently fold in the blueberries.\n6.  **Fill Muffin Cups:** Fill each muffin cup about 2/3 full.\n7.  **Bake:** Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n8.  **Cool:** Let the muffins cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\n**Estimated Nutritional Information (per muffin, assuming 6 muffins total):**\n\n*   Calories: Approximately 250 kcal\n*   Protein: Approximately 5g\n*   Fat: Approximately 8g\n*   Carbohydrates: Approximately 40g\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Calorie Tracking:** This recipe provides approximately 1500 calories for all 6 muffins. You can adjust your other meals during the day to meet your 2000 kcal target.\n*   **Halal:** All ingredients are halal-suitable.\n*   **Adjustments:** You can adjust the sweetness by adding a little more or less brown sugar to your liking.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nSince we've used all the available ingredients, and we are still under the 2000 calorie target, we need to create more recipes, or increase portion sizes.\nIf you would like to explore other vegetarian and halal recipes or adjust your caloric intake, please let me know! I can help you create a more comprehensive meal plan if you can provide more ingredient options."
