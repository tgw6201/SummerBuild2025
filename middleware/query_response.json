  "response": "I apologize, the previous attempt included pork, which is not halal and therefore doesn't meet the user's dietary requirements.  The available ingredients also present a challenge in creating a 2000 kcal vegetarian, halal meal plan within the given restrictions.  The provided ingredients are insufficient to create a complete 2000 kcal meal.\n\nTo create a suitable meal plan, we need significantly more ingredients.  The current ingredients would only make a small portion of a meal.  I need a more comprehensive list of ingredients to help the user reach their 2000 kcal target while adhering to their dietary restrictions and allergies.\n\nCould you please provide a more extensive list of available ingredients?  Ideally, this list would include a variety of fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, and halal-certified protein sources (e.g., chicken, lamb, chickpeas, lentils).\n"
